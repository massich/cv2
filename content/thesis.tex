\cvitem{description}{
  My thesis was devoted to automatic segmentation of breast lesions in
  ultrasound images, since this task is key for the development of robust

  systems applied to this organ and image modality. The proposed segmentation
  strategy divides the images into small meaningful regions that are contiguous,
  and uses optimization to label them based on training data and regularization
  criteria.
